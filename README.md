# Q & A

**Why did you write this?**

I have been unemployed for longer than I care to talk about. Writing this was an effort to put into words some of the frustrations encountered over the many months. 

**Are these real events described?**

Some of the events described are composities of multiple events but for the most part, yes everything is real. 

**Are you a real person?**

Yes.

**Are you looking for employment?**

Yes. I am seasoned System Administrator familiar with implementation and life cycle support of bare metal
hardware, virtual machines, and maintenance of applications and services. I am not afraid to dig in and learn things.
